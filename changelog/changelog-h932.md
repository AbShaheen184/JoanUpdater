•  If you need swipe gesture on lockscreen then flash jolla kernel,(Attached in OP)

•  Added sprint LTE APN settings.

>> Known Bugs.
No any for me. You can test it and lemme know.

Note: Since TWRP is still not compatible to flash OTA automatically. You can use stock recovery for this (Link in the thread) or just install manually rom /data/havoc_updates.
